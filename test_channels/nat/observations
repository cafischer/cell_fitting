Tests:

1) How does the current in response to voltage steps look like? Does it fit experimental data?
2) Do different channels act similarly (shape and and magnitude of the evoked current)?
2) How does this effect AP firing?
3) How strong do the parameters change the shape and magnitude of the ionic current and effect AP firing?

1) 


2)
- same ena, same celsius
-> gbar of the different channels can have quite different orders of magnitude to achieve similar current flow: g_nax=0.0000022, g_nafast=0.000023 vs gna=0.0082, nafast shows slower inactivation, hh channel has quite different shape

3) 
- same ena, ek, celsiu, gnabar, gkbar
-> although current traces are different by over three orders of magnitude is the AP nearly the same for hh2, na, nafast and a little bit bigger for nax
